# ForeverGuide agent guidance

ForeverGuide runs on WoW Forever's beta client. The `.toc` file determines Lua load order;
`Init.lua` boots last. Use Lua 5.1 syntax. Game API values may be secret in combat: inspect
`Core.lua`'s `ns.Plain*`/`ns.Safe` helpers before comparing, converting, or displaying them.
Verify client-dependent behavior in-game; the headless mock is not the client.

## Change the source of truth

- Guide steps: edit `guides-src/*.json` ([schema](guides-src/SCHEMA.md)), then run
  the guide compiler (command below) and commit the generated `Guides/` changes.
- Quest data: check [Data/README.md](Data/README.md) for source and redistribution
  constraints before editing inputs. Generated `Data/*.lua` is not hand-edited.
- Engine: follow the existing `ns` module convention and `.toc` load order. Add a new
  file to the `.toc` only if the feature actually needs it.

## Look up Forever's API

Forever is its own flavor ("Camelot"): Classic and Retail docs and memory are wrong about its API.
Before using or debugging any game function, event, or template, look it up in the pinned
[Gethe/wow-ui-source](https://github.com/Gethe/wow-ui-source) `forever` branch, commit
`bd2470aed543f72697a044e989285b6c83e63f73` (the build `tools/check_forever_api.py` pins):

```text
git clone --branch forever https://github.com/Gethe/wow-ui-source.git <dir>
git -C <dir> checkout bd2470aed543f72697a044e989285b6c83e63f73
```

- Namespaced calls (`C_*`): `Interface/AddOns/Blizzard_APIDocumentationGenerated/`.
- Globals, return shapes, and how a feature is really read: grep Blizzard's own code, preferring
  `*/Camelot/` files (e.g. skills come from `C_SkillInfo`, one table per line, in
  `Blizzard_UIPanels_Game/Camelot/SkillsFrame.lua`).
- After adding calls: `python3 tools/check_forever_api.py <dir>`.

When Forever ships a new build, move the pin (commit here, `VERSION` in the checker) together.

## Test the contract, not your code

1. For a bug, reproduce it with a check that fails **before** changing production code.
   For a feature, state an observable expected result independently of the implementation.
2. Use the existing `tools/test/run_tests.lua` mock for behavior it can actually simulate.
   Assert the meaningful outcome and at least one failure/boundary case when relevant.
   A check that only mirrors a new constant or mock implementation does not prove behavior.
3. Keep existing assertions intact unless the intended behavior changed; explain that
   change and its evidence in the PR. Never relax an expectation merely to get green.
4. Run the relevant checks below. Report their results and what they cannot cover.
   Test `/reload`, login persistence, and combat in-game where relevant.

Prefer one focused regression check over tests for trivial edits. A passing mock does
not establish that an API exists on this client or that an action is allowed in combat.

## Validate locally (Windows, Linux, macOS)

Install [Lua 5.1](https://www.lua.org/download.html) or [LuaJIT](https://luajit.org/install.html),
[Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [Luacheck](https://github.com/lunarmodules/luacheck),
and optionally [LuaLS](https://luals.github.io/#install). Run from the addon root; use the
executable names provided by your installation (`lua -v` must report 5.1; plain `lua` may
be newer). On Windows, `py -3` often replaces `python3`. No Unix shell script is required.

Use `luajit` in place of `lua5.1` if necessary, and `py -3` in place of
`python3` on Windows. Run the compiler without `--check` only after editing guides:

```text
lua5.1 tools/test/run_tests.lua
python3 tools/compile_guides.py --check
luacheck --std lua51 --no-global --no-unused-args --no-max-line-length Core.lua Database.lua Events.lua Persist.lua Player.lua Navigation.lua Guide.lua DB.lua
lua-language-server --check . --checklevel=Warning
```

The Luacheck command covers **eight** engine files and suppresses game-provided global
warnings; it is not whole-addon lint. LuaLS is optional/editor-assisted: inspect its
reported diagnostics on the files you changed. Until WoW API stubs and a scoped LuaLS
config exist, its workspace report can be noisy and is not a passing type-check gate.
Use annotations for known contracts rather than labeling unknown values `any` just to
silence a diagnostic. Neither tool replaces the Lua tests or in-game checks.
